This theme should be used only as a text menu.

The clock is meant to be disabled, as well as all indicators, other than the battery meter (and the game and watch directory name will probably cover that, if friendly folder names are enabled).

Also, region and other rom details are probably best left hidden, as well as any pop ups mentioning things like the amount of files in a directory.

I previews/boxart are disabled (alpha = 0) and the help/info panel doesn't display correctly. I don't use those things.

I don't want to worry about previews or games information, I just want to select something and run it, while matching the color scheme of my handheld.

Enjoy!
